# Vacation Quiz
Epicods Code Review, 1/2016
Created by Wren Withers

## Description:

Vacations was written for a code review during my second week at epicodus.

It uses branching to reccommend one of three travel locations, based on five true or false questions.

To try the quiz, or look at a functioning version of the program, go to:

## Known Issues:

Currently the program requires case sensitive replies in response to the questions, and there is no feedback given
when questions go unanswered. It's also not very pretty.

## Technologies:
JQuery, Javascript, and Bootstrap
